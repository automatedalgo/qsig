# QSig

QSig is a free and open source Python based platform to research quantitative signals and crypto-coin trading strategies.

QSig provides the building blocks to access vendor tick-data, to transform that into research data, and to help early stage alpha signal research.

QSig provides the following components:

- downloaders to fetch vendor data from binance, Tardis
- conventions on how to store
- dataframe/timeseries database that helps you organise your research data
- plotting utilities
- sample indicators
- basic backtester


## Where to start

First you need to install QSig.  You can either use pip to install it into your
local python environment (`pip install .`), or if you don't want to take that
approach, just add the root git directory to your `PYTHONPATH`.

Once you installed you can try running any of the programs found in the
`examples/` folder.
